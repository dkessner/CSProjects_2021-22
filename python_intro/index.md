We're going to use the free 
[Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

The Anaconda distribution includes [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/), which
is a web-based interactive development environment that is useful for doing
data analysis and visualization.

Python basics:
- variables, dynamic typing
- lists
- loops
- conditions
- functions
