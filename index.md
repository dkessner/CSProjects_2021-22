Hello CS Projects coders!

This class is for you to explore new areas of computer science, and to work on
projects that are interesting to you.

Some opportunities we will have this year:

- video projections for the All School Dance Concert, in collaboration with our
  student dancers and choreographers

- data analysis and visualization in partnership with local non-profit
  organizations, in collaboration with our Social Justice and Community
  Partnerships Program

- web-based visual novels / narrative video games, in collaboration with the
  History and Social Sciences Department

- anything else you're interested in!


I'm looking forward to seeing what you create this year!


Dr. Kessner
