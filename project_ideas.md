# Video Projections - All School Dance Concert

You will have the opportunity to work with dancers/choreographers to create
video projections (or something else?) for the All School Dance Concert.  This
would probably be a Processing project.  The "something else" might be a
hardware project if you're interested (Arduino, wearable LEDs + sensors).

# Data Analysis and Visualization

We will spend some time learning the basics of Python for data analysis.
We will also be continuing our collaboration with the Social Justice
and Community Partnerships Program.

# Visual Novels / Narrative Video Games

We will also learn some basic web development (HTML/CSS/Javascript).  

We will use the [Monogatari](https://monogatari.io/) [visual
novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel) engine, working with some of
Dr. Lynch's history classes on a history project.

# Anything else 

Let me know if there is any other project you might want to work on.

Some ideas:
- Processing:
    - video game
    - generative art
    - 3D graphics / VR
    - Kinect depth sensor
    - mathematical simulations
- Arduino:
    - wearable / physical computing
    - interactive LEDs, sensors
- Javascript / p5.js:
    - graphics on web pages
